# Preface {.unnumbered}

**This is a working draft.**


This online textbook is based on notes from a series of lectures given for a few years at the Aristotle University of  Thessaloniki in the Laboratory of Hygiene, Social-Preventive Medicine & Medical Statistics.

This textbook can be used as support material for lectures on R at any level from beginner to advanced. We have paid particular attention to the form of the book, which we think should aid understanding. It can also be used as a support for self-teaching.


All sections of this textbook are reproducible as they were made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)^Â®^ which is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
