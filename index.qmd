# Preface {.unnumbered}

This online textbook is based on my notes from a series of lectures given for a few years at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

This textbook can be used as support material for lectures on basic statistics using R at any level from beginner to advanced. I have paid particular attention to the form of the book, which I think should aid understanding the most common statistical tests using base R and pipe-friendly functions, coherent with the 'tidyverse' design philosophy. It can also be used as a support for self-teaching.
