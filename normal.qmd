# Normal distribution {#sec-normal}

There are several important probability distributions in statistics. However, the normal distribution might be the most important. This distribution is also referred to as "*Gaussian*" or "*Gauss*" distribution.

When we have finished this chapter, we should be able to:

## The shape of a normal distribution

A normal distribution is a symmetric "bell-shaped" probability distribution where most of the observed data are clustered around a central location. Data farther from the central location occur less frequently (@fig-normal).

::: column-margin
Normal distribution, technically a probability density function, is a distribution defined by two parameters, mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. The mean, $\mu$, is a "location parameter", which defines the central tendency. The variance, $\sigma^2$, is the "scale parameter", which defines the width and height of the distribution. It's formally given as:

$$ f(x)={\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}} $$

where $\pi \approx 3.142$ and $e \approx 2.718$.

```

The Normal distribution has the properties summarized as follows:

-   Bell shaped and symmetrical around the mean. Shape statistics, skewness and excess kurtosis are zero.

-   The peak of the curve lies above the mean.

-   Any position along the horizontal axis (x-axis) can be expressed as a number of standard deviations from the mean.

-   All three measures of central location mean, median, and mode are the same.

-   **The empirical rule** (also called the "68-95-99 rule"). Much of the area (68%) of the distribution is between -1 $\sigma$ below the mean and +1 $\sigma$ above the mean, the large majority (95%) between -1.96 $\sigma$ below the mean and +1.96 $\sigma$ above the mean (often used as a reference range), and almost all (99%) between -2.58 $\sigma$ below the mean and +2.58 $\sigma$ above the mean. The total area under the curve equals to 1 (or 100%), almost -3 $\sigma$ below the mean and +3 $\sigma$ above the mean.

## Shape statistics and normality

There are two shape statistics that can indicate deviation from normality: **skewness** and **excess kurtosis**.

**A. Skewness**

Skewness is usually described as a measure of a distribution's symmetry -- or lack of symmetry. Skewness values that are **negative** indicate a tail to the **left** (@fig-skew2 a), **zero** value indicate a **symmetric** distribution (@fig-skew2 b), while values that are **positive** indicate a tail to the **right** (@fig-skew2 c).

::: callout-tip
## Normal distribution and skewness

The skewness for a normal distribution is zero. In practice, approximate bell-shaped curves have skewness values between −1 and +1. Values from −1 to −3 or from +1 to +3 indicate that the distribution is tending away from symmetry with \>1 indicating moderate skewness and \>2 indicating severe skewness. Any values **below−3** or **above +3** are a good indication that the distribution is **not symmetric**, therefore, the variable can not be normally distributed.

**B. Excess kurtosis**

The other way that distributions can deviate from normality is **kurtosis**. The **excess kurtosis**[^normal-1] parameter is a measure of the combined weight of the tails relative to the rest of the distribution. Kurtosis is associated indirect with the peak of the distribution (if the peak of the distribution is too high/sharp or too low compared to a "normal" distribution).

[^normal-1]: Excess kurtosis is commonly used because for a normal distribution is equal to zero, while the kurtosis is equal to 3.

Distributions with **negative** excess kurtosis are called ***platykurtic*** (@fig-kurtosis a). If the measure of excess kurtosis is **zero** the distribution is **mesokurtic** (@fig-kurtosis b). Finally, distributions with **positive** excess kurtosis are called ***leptokurtic*** (@fig-kurtosis c).

::: callout-tip
## Normal distribution and excess kurtosis

The excess kurtosis for a normal distribution is zero. In practice, approximate normal distributions have excess kurtosis values between −1 and +1. Values from −1 to −3 or from +1 to +3 indicate that the distribution is tending away from a mesokurtic distribution. Any values **below −3** or **above +3** are a good indication that the distribution is **not mesokurtic**, therefore, the variable can not be normally distributed.

## Normal Q-Q plots

The **normal Q--Q plot**, or normal quantile-quantile plot, provides an easy way to visually check whether or not a data set is normally distributed. The values in the plot are the **quantiles**[^normal-2] of the variable distribution (sample quantiles) plotted against the quantiles of a standard normal distribution (theoretical quantiles). If the points fall along a roughly **straight** line at a 45-degree angle (although the ends of the Q-Q plot often start to deviate from the straight line), then the data is normally distributed. If the variable is normally distributed, the, points fall close to a **straight** line . Any **deviations** from the straight line indicate some degree of non-normality.

[^normal-2]: Quantiles are values that split sorted data or a probability distribution into equal parts. The most commonly used quantiles have special names. <br>**Quartiles** (4-quantiles): Three quartiles split the data into four parts. **Percentiles** (100-quantiles): 99 percentiles split the data into 100 parts.
