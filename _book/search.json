In an experiment designed to test the effectiveness of paroxetine for treating bipolar depression, the participants were randomly assigned into two groups (paroxetine Vs placebo). The researchers used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) to measure the depression state of the participants and wanted to find out if the HDRS score is different in paroxetine group as compared to placebo group at the end of the experiment. The significance level \\(\\alpha\\) was set to 0.05.\nNote: A score of 0–7 in HDRS is generally accepted to be within the normal range, while a score of 20 or higher indicates at least moderate severity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull hypothesis and alternative hypothesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_0\\): the means of HDRS in the two groups are equal (\\(\\mu_{1} = \\mu_{2}\\))\n\n\\(H_1\\): the means of HDRS in the two groups are not equal (\\(\\mu_{1} \\neq \\mu_{2}\\))"

Based on these results, there is not evidence that paroxetine is effective as a treatment for bipolar depression.\nNote that the paroxetine group (n=33) has df (degrees of freedom) = 33-1 = 32 and the placebo sample (n= 43) has df = 43-1 = 42 , so we have df = 32 + 42 = 74 in total. Another way of thinking of this is that the complete sample size is 76, and we have estimated two parameters from the data (the two means), so we have df = 76-2 = 74 .\nThe Student t-test for two independent samples does not have any restrictions on \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) —they can be equal or unequal. However, equal samples are preferred because when a total of 2n subjects are available, their equal division among the groups maximizes the power to detect a specified difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember\n\n\n\nIf the variance is different between the two groups then the degrees of freedom and the t-value associated with a two-sample t-test are calculated differently. In this case, we have to write var.equal = F (or write nothing because this is the default) in the function so the Welch-Satterthwaite approximation is applied to the degrees of freedom.\n\n\n \nPresent the results in a summary table\n\nShow the codegt_sum1 <- depression %>% \n  tbl_summary(\n    by = intervention, \n    statistic = HDRS ~ \"{mean} ({sd})\", \n    digits = list(everything() ~ 1),\n    label = list(HDRS ~ \"HDRS score\"), \n    missing = c(\"no\")) %>% \n  add_p(test = HDRS ~ \"t.test\", purrr::partial(style_pvalue, digits = 2),\n        test.args = all_tests(\"t.test\") ~ list(var.equal = TRUE)) %>% \n  add_overall() %>%\n  as_gt() \n\ngt_sum1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\n      \nOverall, N = 761\n\n      \nparoxetine, N = 331\n\n      \nplacebo, N = 431\n\n      \np-value2\n\n    \n\nHDRS score\n21.0 (3.5)\n20.3 (3.7)\n21.5 (3.4)\n0.16\n\n\n\n\n1 Mean (SD)\n    \n\n\n2 Two Sample t-test\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nHence, there is not evidence that HDRS score is significantly different in paroxetine group, mean = 20.3 (sd = 3.7), as compared to placebo group, 21.5 (3.4), (mean difference= -1.16 units, 95% CI = -2.78 to 0.47, p = 0.16 >0.05)."
