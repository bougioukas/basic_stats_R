</header><p><strong>Correlation</strong> is a statistical method used to assess a possible <strong>association</strong> between two numeric variables, X and Y. There are several statistical coefficients that we can use to quantify correlation depending on the underlying relation of the data. In this chapter, we’ll learn about four correlation coefficients:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pearson’s <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Spearman’s <span class="math inline">\(r_{s}\)</span> and Kendall’s <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span></p></li>

<p>A first step that is usually useful in studying the association between two numeric variables is to prepare a scatter plot of the data. The pattern made by the points plotted on the scatter plot usually suggests the basic nature and strength of the association between two variables.</p>

<p>The points in the scatter plot seem to be scattered around an invisible line. The scatter plot also shows that, in general, infants with high height tend to have high weight (positive association).</p>
<p>Additionally, the marginal histograms show that the data are approximately normally distributed (we have a large sample so the graphs are reliable) for both weight and height.</p>

<p><strong>Correlation coefficients</strong></p>
<p>Pearson’s coefficient measures <strong>linear</strong> correlation, while the Spearman’s and Kendall’s coefficients compare the <strong>ranks</strong> of data and measures <strong>monotonic</strong> associations. These coefficients are very powerful for detecting linear or monotonic associations, respectively. The new <span class="math inline">\(ξ\)</span> correlation coefficient is more appropriate to measure the strength of non-monotonic associations.</p>
<p>Note that the correlation between variables X and Y is equal to the correlation between variables Y and X so the order of the variables in the functions does not matter. The four correlations coefficients are:</p>

<p>The Pearson’s correlation coefficient can be calculated for any dataset with two numeric variables. However, before we calculate the Pearson’s coefficient we should make sure that the following assumptions are met:</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions for Pearson’s</strong> <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> coefficient</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The variables are observed on a <strong>random sample</strong> of individuals (each individual should have a pair of values).</li>

<li>
<strong>Absence of outliers</strong> in the data set.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pearson’s <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> coefficient is a dimensionless quantity that takes a value in the range -1 to +1.

<p>The basic idea of Spearman’s rank correlation is that the <strong>ranks of X and Y</strong> are obtained by first separately ordering their values from small to large and then computing the correlation between the two sets of ranks. The strength of correlation is denoted by the coefficient of rank correlation, named Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(r_{s}\)</span>.</p>
