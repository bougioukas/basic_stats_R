<p>We want to compare two screening questionnaires for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among smokers aged &gt;45 years in the primary care setting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>International Primary Care Airways Group (IPAG)</em> questionnaire (Score: 0-38)</li>
<li>
<em>COPD Population Screener (COPDPS)</em> questionnaire (Score: 0-10)</li>

<p>The diagnosis of COPD was based on spirometric criterion (FEV 1 /FVC &lt;0.7 following bronchodilation), clinical status (medical history, symptoms and physical examination), and exclusion of other diseases.</p>

<li><p>For screening purposes such as mammogram, the cut-off point can be selected to favor a higher sensitivity. Thus, a negative test result indicates the absent of the disease (SeNout; sensitive, negative, “rule out” the disease).</p></li>
<li><p>For confirmative diagnosis purposes, for example, when a chemotherapy is to initiated once the diagnosis is established, the cut-off point can be selected to favor a higher specificity. Thus, a positive test result indicates the presence of disease (SpPin; specificity, positive, “rule in” the disease).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, for a given diagnostic test, we can consider all cut-off points that give a unique pair of values for sensitivity and specificity. We can plot in a graph, which is known as a <strong>ROC curve</strong>, the sensitivity on the y-axis and 1-specificity (false positives) values on the x-axis for all these possible cut-off points of the diagnostic test. Then, the <strong>area under the ROC curve</strong> (AUC of ROC), also called the c-statistic, can be calculated which is a widely used measure of overall performance.</p>

<p>The results using the cut-off point of 17 give Se = 0.744 (0.687 - 0.794) and Sp = 0.722 (0.703 - 0.740). We observe that the probability of the absence of COPD given a negative test result is high NPV = 0.960 (95% CI: 0.949, 0.969) in this sample with smokers.</p>
